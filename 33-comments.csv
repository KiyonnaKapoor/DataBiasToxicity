1,I agree with Billfruge The author describes the unverifiable nature of the two competing etymology theories sufficiently well so as not to mislead any reader renders an opinion as to which of the two is more likely and it is clear that this is the authors opinion and presents the reader with the opportunity to accept either or neither of the two

5,  There are now four references including Britannica giving the correct date which is getting silly You complain in your edit summary that you cant find them so Ive added quotes to two to help you out After that youre on your own wpsourceaccess has more on this Im happy to concede that Britannica alone mentions the date you offer but without explaining the context so thats one of the sources Ive expanded with a quote specifically mentioning 23 August   Russian Wikipedia has  August 23 forces of the 14th Tank Corps Army of Paulus reached the Volga north of Stalingrad cited from the war diary of ColonelGeneral Franz Haider

9,  That is ridiculous Unless theres a good and nondisingenuous response I would absolutely agree with you blocking indef outright Falsifying sources should simply never be tolerated

12,Thanks for the comment about Wikidefenderness I like that one I usually wikiling Wikidefender I agree that at first he was somewhat innocent but now have my doubts as he is being really agressive about the whole matter

14,Agree but thats not the issue The queston is in everyday English does first amendent refer primarily to the US Constitution or is it ambiguous My belief remains that even fifth amendment is ambiguous and first amendment even more so      
15,   Main towns that are not so main   I know that you love to write a one sentence article But if you want to do that please at least do it properly Stop saying X is a main town in Y Z What is so main about obscure towns   
16,   Halliday   Good to see another contributor to his article If SFL is your thing you might consider joining the WikipediaWikiProjectLinguisticsSFLSFL taskforce Thanks   
17,   That Stephen Barrett is not Board Certified is not a viewpoint It is a fact a well documented one at that I dont see how WPPROMINENCE applies    
18,Could you do a precis of the material instead of just downloading a whole lot of stuff from somewhere else on the internet I am only one editor here but I do feel that the material you have provided could be cut down to fit the format of this article More info could be provided in a seperate wikipedia article if necessary
19,   Cloud feedback   Why is cloud feedback only under the positive feedbacks Just about any paper states that it can be both That the IPCC states that it is more likely a positive than a negative feedback doesnt change that   
20,Avg plenty of Greeks love the King Stop acting like all Greeks hate him You just parrot what the government tells us via their media We Greeks asked George I to be our King We supported them They reclaimed much of our lands We voted to keep them numerous times In the 1930s by 97 vote  Also he tried to overthrow the dictators Read a book The Greek government is the biggest liars The US didnt want us to have our King and our claim to ConstantinopleAsia Minor He is a direct descendant of five Greek imperial Byzantine dynasties Monomachos Comnenos Laskaris Angelos and Paleologos

22, Second issue   Im thinking we need a taxonomy section there are things that arent really as clear as they maybe could be Why iswhat specific findings about the fossils places R narmadensis in the subfamily Carnotaurinae Why princely lizard of the Narmada is that significant as to the staturebehaviorpredatorial prowess of R narmadensis If there is anything more precise on its taxonomy such as that it would be great to add
23,    Another priceless gem from yourself demonstrating your general cluelessness The fuse rating and therefore the plug rating in the case of a nonrewireable plug is determined by the cable attached not the appliance it will be used with Where on earth did you dig that nonsense up from There are plenty of good examples around but medium to large switch mode power supplies are often supplied with nominally 3 Amp cable in a moulded on plug many with an IEC 60320 C7 type plug rated by that standard at 25 Amps According to you the plug should therefore be fitted with a 3 Amp fuse determined by the cable If you did so you would never get any but the smallest power supplies running You have to fit a 5 Amp fuse because the very large 40 Amp momentary inrush current lasts long enough that it will blow a 3 Amp fuse The cable and plug can retain their original ratings because the inrush current will not harm them The rating of the fuse is determined by much much more than the cable size alone Indeed the type of power supply that is built into a plug usually has no fuse at all   1717
24,  Firstly still making undiffable edits and refusing to use edit summaries is becoming a behavioural issue that will need to be escalated if it doesnt stop Gun I really dont understand why you find it so hard to follow the basic standards of behaviour required to edit in a collaborative environment  Secondly announcing changes on someones talk page doesnt really count as discussing them collaboratively rather it means you discussed it with me  Furthermore I told you to go to the NPOV noticeboard to raise the State University vs University issue if you wanted to discuss the issue which you a failed to do b you removed the disputed tag from the article without a result as I suggested waiting until later c you made yet another diff which contained a large number of other unknown unknowable and undisucssed changes to the article    
25,  Name in the introductory paragraph  Ive always been told that using Dr  PhD in the same name was incorrect as the PhD automatically conferred the status of doctor   However Im not sure what to do in this case  Since he is so wellknown as Dr Martin Luther King Jr the normal approach of dropping Dr and keeping PhD doesnt seem to be the best answer even though its the one most style guides seem to endorse  Would someone more intimately familliar with the article like to take a swing at changing it or suggesting an alternative   
26, Mrpainkiller Neurophyte and JeanPhilippe   After a complaint at intervention against vandalism I protected the article VampireFreakscom  It was either that or block all of you for disruption and personal attacks  I will unprotect the article in the morning  In the meantime please consider the following  Reverting another users talk page is pretty rude  There is a policy conflict between the user talk page policy which says users can blank or archive warnings although archiving is preferred by the community and the vandalism policy which says that removing warnings given to you is vandalism  I dont agree with the vandalism point of view and I havent seen a lot of support for it lately except among people who are fighting amongst themselves for other reasons  If someone deletes a warning theyve obviously seen it  If you are concerned about someones edits use a verbose edit summary so that even if the warning is removed the edit summary will be visible  I understand there is a view among two of you that Mrpainkiller7s edits are detrimental to the article  There are lots of right ways to deal with this including editing by consensus Request for comment on the article or the user Mediation and third opinion  Im not going to judge the content but fighting wherever it occurs is the wrong way to deal with the problem  Personal attacks are not to be tolerated  Please deal with the content of edits not character   Im leaving this message with each of you  If you keep fighting over talk pages I suppose I or another admin will eventually figure its time to block someone  Unless you are positive that you are 100 right and the other guy is 100 wrong you should probably try and work this out peacefully in case the admins dont see things your way
27, black mamba   Itis ponious snake of the word and but it not kills many people but king cobra kills many people in India
28,Looks like this was an old issue so I took the liberty of removing it I dont see any difference between the nonspaced version and the spaced version now The spaced version just makes the intro look very strange
29,I just revamped WPFART I thought a little housekeeping would give it more street cred
30,Does JP Harris have anything to say about the Ancre
31, Dont feed the troll   Responding with taunting is exactly the wrong way to respond  Dont feed the troll  Remove the post without comment or dont do anything at all
32,  Please accept my apologies  I interpreted your statement Find a quote yourself or move it I dont care to mean that you thought the source could be removed instead of finding a quote  My mistake   
33,While I tend to agree with all of this and am as slightly annoyed as anyone that we appear to have been blamed even though our article was accurate and respectful at all times and Mr Roth was treated with dignity and respect at all times its always in my nature to think about how we might do better in the future
